# Trivium - Networked Trivia System

## Current Status: Converting to Networked Architecture

### What We've Built So Far:
- React/TypeScript trivia webapp with Art Deco styling
- Three modes: Landing, Big Screen (audience display), Host (game control)
- localStorage-based sync between tabs on same device
- Customizable game title/subtitle, question counters, wait screens
- Timer controls, category selection, question management
- Export/import functionality for questions

### Current Implementation:
- **Frontend**: React with localStorage sync between browser tabs
- **Questions**: Stored locally in browser localStorage
- **Game State**: Synced via localStorage + storage events
- **Limitation**: Only works on single device, no network sync

### What We're Converting To:
- **Backend Server**: Node.js + Express + WebSocket + SQLite
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket for game state across network
- **Centralized Questions**: SQLite database on host machine
- **Multi-device**: Any device can connect to host's IP address
- **API**: REST endpoints for question CRUD operations

### Architecture Plan:
```
/server
  â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ server.js         # Express + WebSocket server
  â”œâ”€â”€ database.js       # SQLite setup & question queries  
  â”œâ”€â”€ gameState.js      # Game state management
  â””â”€â”€ routes/
      â”œâ”€â”€ questions.js  # Question API endpoints
      â””â”€â”€ game.js       # Game state API
```

### Frontend Changes Needed:
- Replace localStorage with WebSocket client
- Replace question localStorage with API calls
- Add server connection handling
- Keep existing UI/UX unchanged

### Future Feature Ideas:
- Player mode: Audience joins with phones to submit answers
- Scoring system for player mode
- Admin dashboard for multiple games

### Current Task:
Clear previous game answers when new game starts to prevent carryover between games.

## Progress Log:

### 2025-06-30 - Power Outage Recovery
- **Status Check**: Found mid-conversion state with modified files:
  - server/database.js, server/gameState.js, server/server.js
  - src/TriviaApp.tsx, src/hooks/useNetworkedGame.ts
  - src/services/api.ts, src/services/websocket.ts
  - New files: server/routes/answers.js, server/routes/players.js
- **Server Status**: Syntax validated, appears functional
- **Next**: Continue networked architecture implementation

### 2025-06-30 - Question Types Implementation
- **Added Question Type Support**: 
  - Database schema: `type` column ('multiple_choice' | 'write_in')
  - Updated question form with type selector
  - Multiple choice: Traditional A/B/C/D options
  - Write-in: Text area for player answers, host reviews submissions
- **Frontend Updates**:
  - Player interface: Conditional rendering for question types
  - Big Screen: Shows write-in indicator vs option buttons
  - Question management: Type selector with conditional options display
- **Update**: Added question type selector to edit question modal
- **Fix**: Removed "0" appearing in Big Screen waiting mode (React conditional rendering issue)
  - Root cause: SQLite stored booleans as integers (0/1), so `gameState.showQuestionCounter` was 0 instead of false
  - When `{0 && filteredQuestions.length > 0}` evaluated, React rendered the "0" as text
  - Fixed by converting SQLite integer booleans to JavaScript booleans in database queries
  - Also converted `&&` conditionals to ternary operators for safety
  - Added missing `player_mode` column to database schema
- **New Feature**: Added image support for questions
  - Database: Added `image_url` column to questions table with migration
  - Forms: Added image URL input to both Add/Edit question forms  
  - Display: Images show above questions in Big Screen and Player views
  - Error handling: Images hide automatically if URL fails to load
  - Example: Added sample question with Unsplash image
- **Fix**: Multiple choice questions showing as write-in
  - Added migration to fix NULL question types in existing data
  - Added frontend fallback to default to 'multiple_choice' if type missing
- **Fix**: Image URLs not saving/showing in edit
  - Updated handleAddQuestion and handleUpdateQuestion to include image_url field
  - Fixed form validation to allow write-in questions without options
  - Fixed form reset to include all new fields
  - Added manual refreshQuestions() calls to update frontend after save
  - Fixed API routes to include type and image_url fields in requests
  - Fixed WebSocket broadcasts to include complete question data
- **Fix**: Write-in question creation issues
  - Made answer field optional for write-in questions in database and validation
  - Updated frontend validation to allow write-in questions without options/answer
  - Updated UI to show "Sample Answer (optional)" for write-in questions
- **New Feature**: Host interface for write-in question scoring
  - Added real-time submission display for write-in questions in host panel
  - Created point awarding interface with +1, +3, +5 point buttons for each submission
  - Shows player answers in readable format with timestamps
  - Integrates with existing scoring system to update player scores
  - Filters out empty submissions, shows only answered ones
- **Fix**: Clear previous game answers when new game starts
  - Added `clearAllPlayerAnswers()` method to database to delete all player answers
  - Updated game start/end endpoints to clear all answers from database
  - **Critical Fix**: Updated WebSocket `handleGameAction` to also clear database (frontend uses WebSocket, not REST)
  - Added frontend logic to clear local answer state when game state changes
  - Fixed timing issues and state management for answer clearing
  - Prevents player answers from carrying over between games
  - Added console logging for debugging answer clearing
- **Fix**: Real-time player response updates in host panel
  - Fixed WebSocket answer update handler to work regardless of game state
  - Added `all_answers_cleared` WebSocket event and handling
  - Host panel now updates immediately when players submit answers
  - Added proper WebSocket broadcasting when database answers are cleared
  - **Critical Fix**: Unified answer state management - removed duplicate state between hook and component
  - Fixed React re-rendering issues by using hook's real-time questionAnswers state
  - Added auto-loading of answers for current question in host mode
  - Fixed appMode filtering that was preventing updates
  - **Final Fix**: Real-time updates now work for both multiple choice and write-in questions
  - Fixed question ID mismatch issue - answers update for any question, not just current one
  - Multiple choice statistics (counts/percentages) update immediately when players submit answers
- **Enhancement**: Improved write-in question answer display
  - Hide "correct answer" box for write-in questions that don't have a predefined answer
  - When revealing answers, show awarded player responses with point values
  - Track which answers received points and display them prominently
  - Support multiple point awards to same player (points accumulate)
  - Awarded answers appear on both Big Screen and player screens when answer is revealed
  - **CURRENT STATUS**: Points awarding works (backend & state), but awarded answers not displaying on answer reveal
    - Fixed player ID field mismatch (`player_id` vs `id`)
    - Points buttons functional: Award points and track in state correctly
    - State shows awarded answers: `{7: [{playerId: 34, playerName: 'lopooj', answer: 'oiuhjhfjkh', points: 3}]}`
    - **REMAINING ISSUE**: Display logic not triggering when "Show Answer" clicked
    - Need to debug: `ðŸŽ­ Big Screen awarded answers display check:` console message
    - All debugging infrastructure in place for tomorrow's session
